0,5,"Good phone at this price point
Camera is by far the best among all other phones. Wide angle lens is quite accurate with colours and distortion is manageable. Portrait AI is good. HDR gives a sense of false positivity but makes the picture looks better compared to a dslr.
iOS doesn't hang and makes multitasking pretty easy.
Battery is ok. Extensive user like me (9-10h) screen time needs to charge twice daily.considering the usage its ok.
Screen size and display is awesome. Fits into jeans eas..."

Firstly, thank you Flipkart for delivering fast and genuine product‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve been always fan of apple‚Äôs products since my college days. Earlier I was using IPhone 7 and skipped other series of IPhone and jumped directly in 12 series. Just go for it without hesitation."

3,5,"Apple iPhone 12 mini is incredible, peaceful to hold on one hand and type a message or browse a website, screen size is bigger, i think the phone size is perfect for me, i was using iPhone SE, it was small as this phone, but screen size was quite small, for me this is the perfect phone.
See those incredible pics."

7,5,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - ..."

11,5,"Switched from iPhone 6s to this device. Surprisingly it‚Äôs more than what I expected. I was a bit worried about the battery but it turned out to be amazing and lasts 1 day easily with a normal usage for a guy like me whose screen time is around 8-9 hours a day.

Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.
Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren‚Äôt pretty useful.

Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback
Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility

16,5,"I switched from an iPhone 6s to a 12 mini and the difference is incredible. Before buying the 12 mini, the two complaints I heard most often from reviewers were about low battery life and the lack of a 120 Hz display. However, especially coming from an older iPhone, I find the battery life to be more than satisfactory and iOS is already so smooth that I hardly notice the lack of a high refresh rate. The main reason for my purchase is its size, so easy to handle and just the way i wanted. Also..."

28,5,"I've been using iPhone 12 mini for past couple of months, If you're in doubt of whether to buy or not. I'd suggest you go ahead. I've used both iPhone 12 and now 12 mini, the only difference you're gonna find is 1hour of battery difference. Irrespective of what kind of user you are the battery difference would be only 1 hour. So if you're interested to take this small compact power machine, go ahead without doubt, since i dont think there's a big difference in that 1 hour mark.

The battery lasts almost a day for me with moderate usage. FYI, I don't play any games. I just love the compact feel of the phone. Although it is a bit slippery and need a case to have a good grip.
The transition from my existing iphone was smooth.

33,5,The in-hand experience of this phone is great. Would definitely recommend buying if you have small hands like me and/or you want a phone that‚Äôs comfortable in your hand! The OLED display feels great and you can really tell the difference when comparing it to iPhone XR or an 11! Camera is superb as well as day to day performance. I know the name‚Äôs Mini but still it‚Äôs bigger than an iPhone 7/8/SE and you will get used to it eventually! The only drawback i‚Äôve found is that the battery life could...

41,4,Some apps for online sellers like that of FlipKart and UniCommerce not too compatible with IOS. Secondly not a single whatsapp chats from Android was transferred to this phone. The built quality of this phone is fine but it‚Äôs too slippery to be used without a case.
42,5,"This is my first Mini, coming from an XR and 7plus, I was a bit apprehensive of going for a small screen, however once I got the phone I knew I had made the right decision.
Purely from an usable form factor, getting used to the small screen, took me all of 60bseconds.
I use my phone primarily for office stuff, and this fits the bill.

43,5,"Camera is good no arguing with that , the processor is really powerful helps me edit images and video faster ‚Ä¶. Battery life is decent 6-7 hours Totally worth it if you watch video and movies on mobile very good colour details you can see ‚Ä¶. You cannot play pubg very comfortably on this phone because of its size ‚Ä¶..totally worth it for me"
44,5,"There was a delay on account of rescheduling from my side. But Flipkart had been exemplary in resolving the issue with courier partners and delivering it finally. So cheers to Flipkart and its customer care executives. It‚Äôs an awesome phone in small form factor if that excites you with outstanding display, camera and performance and one handed usage. Wish the battery had little more juice to last through the day. If u can spend 8 to 10 k extra go and grab it‚Äôs bigger sibling iPhone 12."
45,5,Those who love compact phones this is their life‚Äôs best deal‚Ä¶ A total power packed machine.. simply loving it day by dayüòç‚Ä¶ unlikely this time something provoked apple to release this beast‚Ä¶ anytime soon expecting an update over the camera to stabilize 30 fps on all modes‚Ä¶ hav to talk abt the display‚Ä¶ simply a massive one‚Ä¶
46,5,Thanx Flipkart for solving my issue. Got the beast in 37k on day of sale. Performance booster ideal for people with small hands and liking for small phones. Android is nowhere to is except customizations. Battery is adequate however for gamers need a good PowerBank for fast charging.Got in exchange for Buyback Value for Mi10T
47,5,"It has been nearly 25 days now after I bought iPhone 12 mini and so far the phone performs just like it should! Super fast and super crisp display. Only rouse would be battery which lasts 24 hours on regular use of social media, videos, camera and browsing. So minus point there but this is iPhone 12 mini with smaller size with same performance of iPhone 12. So compromise on the battery was obvious. I just love how Apple managed to keep the size of the phone smaller than iPhone SE 2020 edition..."

Superb deal.. purchased this for my mom.. great cameras
In hand feel is superb.. the small size is apt for my mom.. she can easily use it with one hand.

Update : 21st oct

12 mini is nice for it's looks , feel, cameras, speakers, display

Only battery is just about average.. (when i used for a day i got about 5 hours of screen on time with medium usage) but it's last long when my mom uses.. being the primary user she is very much satisfied with it."
54,4,"I had bought this phone during sale for 37499. It‚Äôs good deal for me. Overall the performance of the phone is good except few things like backup and camera. The camera is not super great, the other phone one plus nord 2 is doing better than this in terms of camera and power back up time. If you are looking for a small phone and for personal use go for it. But if you want to use for business purposes don‚Äôt buy this."
55,5,"Very fast delivery and Genuine Product! Initially, I was thinking to order from Apple online Store, India or Amazon. But I couldn't find the HDFC discount. Flipkart gives instant discount which is not available in any other providers.
Very much happy to purchase from Flipkart and the Phone is working absolutely fine.

Thanks Flipkart"

Battery life could use some work, even with my light use it just lasts a day, so those with heavy use might need to charge this twice or thrice a day. But a smaller battery charges faster so there is that.
Overall, it was a very good deal for what I paid."

69,5,Perfect size. Perfect performance. Havent seen a better camera on a smart phone before. Got it for an awesome 42k. Only thing it lags in is battery. But then if you are like me and you dont travel around much its not a great deal. Screen and performance in general is spotless. Get it definitely if your sick of bulky phones.

Battery life can be improved but with moderate use its giving a full day of charge. Video quality and the sound are the Best. I bought it in sale and I got value for money with this product.
Wanted to mention that the packaging was not good and when I received the parcel I didn't expect that I will receive iPhone in this bad packaging but other t..."
95,5,Trust Me.. Just go for it if you love mini things.. this is a amazing phone. And if you are confused between 12 and 12 mini then just go to physical shop take the phone in your hand and use it for a min.. you will get you answers. Don‚Äôt get confused. Thank you Flipkart for faster delivery and authentic product. They also have provided open box delivery.
96,5,"The size is perfect. Upgrading from iphone SE to this has been super exciting. Go for it without any doubt. The battery backup could have been better but knowing apple that‚Äôs okay. I am not a heavy user and mainly use phone for work and slight multimedia, the battery lasts almost a day."
97,5,"A compact phone with elaborate features of high end device for an affordable amount in high end smartphones. Superbly handy, perfect screen space, battery lasts for almost 24 hrs (with no gaming) and average screen time of 6-7 hrs. Best for those who like sub-six inch phones."
98,5,It was awesome product applause made a new generation utilising that people use very smooth appearance is good I‚Äôm satisfied with this device
99,5,"Guys, size is super cool and very light. It is perfect for those who like small and light mobile. Blue colour looks great, display and sound quality is great. This is my first ever iphone so struggling a bit l, but happy to have iphone, it is very smooth.

The only problem I am facing is w.e.t jio cellular reception, I could see only 1 or 2 network signals in iphone but if I switch to android phone, is show full network signals."
100,5,"No issues with the product...it came on time to my place with well packaged.
Got proper item which I ordered....I am happy with it. Very much impressed with the service..
Carry on the Good job flip kart... Thanks."
101,4,"I liked everything about it but its gets too much hot while playing any game and it‚Äôs battery life is not so good, it‚Äôs just fine if you don‚Äôt use it for gaming. Otherwise, everything is awesome."
102,4,"Good phone , not really worth 40k , but if you‚Äôre an apple lover or would like to try it , not a bad deal. Performance is nice and crisp , battery lasts for almost a day and you get fast charging with the apple adapter, which needs to be bought separately. Camera is amazing along with display and other features. Compact phone, if the size is ok with you , it‚Äôs quite cute."
103,5,"If you‚Äôre ok with the phone being a bit smaller than usual, this is the phone for you. 5g ready with dual sim.. almost a latest phone. You can use it for 4+ years without any haste. I ordered two phones and am happy using it. Thanks for the offer on big billion days sale Flipkart"
104,5,I was using SE 2 and upgrade to this beauty for 34k after bank cashback which is a great deal. Camera is very good and battery is much better than my old SE 2. Very handy and comfortable to use. My primary phone is Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ but now after starting using 12 mini this has become my primary mobile. Thanks Flipkart for an amazing Offer for this beast. Hope other Android Manufacturers also produce same kind of mobiles like under 6 inch will be a good option.
105,1,"Please don‚Äôt buy this mobile. Screen colour is something like yellow, most of the apps are not adjusting to the screen size, sound quality is good but when I am in call I am not able to hear my frnd voice properly and apple cable is too small

Last but not least battery lifeü§¶üëé"
106,5,"I was looking to upgrade my iphone 6s to 11 and got this cute handy phone to 35k during the big billion days. I was bit anxious about its battery back up but now iam very happy with this phone. As a medium user, i am getting full day back up with an average daily use of 4:45 hrs. You will get a maximum of 5:30 hrs screentime with a single full charge. Built quality and performance is as usual top notch."
107,4,"The phone is best suited for those who are looking for a compact phone for day to day task. I will recommend it for heavy gaming like pubg because of the compact screen. As far as the performance is concerned the phone is awesome. Also, battery last for a day even if used whole day. Overall a good experience."
108,5,"You can do everything with your one hand, I like that.. Battery better than previous versions but still need improvements. Screen fits well but should have been better if there weren‚Äôt notch at the top.. Rest iPhone is iPhone no comparison"
109,5,"Everyone knows about the phone from various platforms. Hence I have only a small UX feedback.

Everything is good about the phone if you can precisely touch your screen.

If you have big fingers or you are not very precise in touching the phone is not for you."
110,5,"Very comfortable in hands
Catchy design
Not to mention the smoothness offered by iOS and the A14 Bionic. No lag experienced at all whatsoever
To top it all, you get 5G (which is future proof), ip68 water and dust resistance
Last but not the least, the care you get from Apple support is unlike many support services. Their chat services are very fast
Rest of the specs are at par or above for a phone of this category. No mention needed"
111,5,"Excellent and ergonomic phone. In the world of super big phones, iphone 12 mini is perfect for people who want both small size and top spec performance"
112,5,I was concerned about the size of the phone first as I was using a phone with a size of6‚Äô1 inches but it just took me hardy a week to settle down and now I‚Äôm comfortable with it i just loved the phone the camera is insane the ui and the processor is good everything is great about the phone
113,5,"Well what to say about 12 mini amazing, brilliant, fantastic as always. If you are reading this then you should go ahead and buy this iphone you are gonna be satisfied !"
114,5,It's a excellent product . Easy to use and excellent battery life . Camera no words ...best n excellent charging speed .
115,5,Good handy fast phone I upgraded from Apple SE ..satisfied
116,4,"Am an average user I am really comfortable with the phone only one issue I feel is that overheating the device when we use camera.other than it‚Äôs a good phone having good battery backups around 10-12hrs
Getting good pic and video in natural colour and night mode also superb"
117,5,"good phone sound is good but the only thing you will face with battery. with normal usage, you can use for 12 hr or less but overall is good if you are ready to charge two times in a day"
118,5,I think it‚Äôs the best form factor for an iPhone. Albeit would have loved the iPhone 13 battery capacity in this one! The screen is just absolutely gorgeous and you‚Äôll really enjoy using the phone ! Camera is great as expected.

148,1,"Phone is awesome, no complaints whatsoever. Just a bit concerned about the import date which is showing as nov last year, rest all good.
However Flipkart is kind of scamming people by giving false exchange value of old phones.

This is a phone that‚Äôs fast, with a great camera and a screen you can actually use one handed without accessibility or fear of dropping the phone. Is crazy light and pocket friendly. The screen despite its size is vivid and oled with god neutral colours.

Pathetic experience. I am never going to use Flipkart again for any single purchase."

The camera quality, the processor, the display everything are the highest in comparison with other androids phones.

I was tired of using big chunky heavy phones as my hands are quite small and fingers don't reach all the corners so this was my dream phone to buy. Everything about this phone is great. Only the battery life is bit low but can't complain as it lasts for 6hrs on non-stop use and it's only minor compromise due to smaller size which is more important for me."

I have used i7,i8, been using Xr before this and I can say battery is not that big of a problem, I can use it all day long easily on normal days.

3. Sound and display is perfect and top notch.
4. But the battery is dam poor.Dont know why apple makes such kind of things.u dont get charger adapter ,headphones all we can manage but in a flagship device a poor battery cant goes with the combination..

Due to battery drain it will not be the permanent primary handset.

Else everything is top notch"

screen size and battery are two concerns, rest you also know it's a beast device."

Great screen high pixels packed in small screen

Great performance"

306,4,Still using and searching its wow factors. But night mode camera is awesome.
307,4,The screen is crisp and small.Suitable for one handed operation.Wide angle and normal camera is good.Night mode is also good.Operation is blazing fast.Battery is not up to the mark.Normal operation will easily get through the day.But watching videos drains the battery fast.Face unlock is fast and unlocks even in dark.The issue is wearing mask face doesn't unlock and becomes an inconvenience.Overall good.
308,4,Everything was good . Battery lasts for 7.5hrs if ur using WiFi .

Using this from last 7 days, so I want to say that the mobile is v good
Battery backup on normal use, can last full day in one charge.
Overall performance v v good.
Not a gaming mobile, keep this in mind. 12mini size is v v handy, best thing of this model.
Cam, processor, speakers so good."
312,4,"Loved the small form structure. The only complain is the battery backup. However, considering my use, which is less than normal, the battery works just fine. But a slight heavy user than me would face some battery issues."

1. It has heating issues.
2. Both Jio and Airtel network breaking during the call.
3. Sometimes the corner keys not working properly if not carefully selected.
4. It has battery issues.
Looks like I received a faulty product from Flipkart. Flipkart service is getting worse day by day. They are unable to replace the product.
So, just think 100 times before buying this product."

Facing issue related battery, taking more time from 1 to 100 percent.
After 80% it takes too much time more than half our tried to connect with Apple care but suggested for restore which is still pending.
Enabling wifi keeps refusing with pop-up.
Small percent of heat is there while charging,if net is turned on and phone is on charge battery won't be charging it remains same if it was 5% so it will be same for longer time.
Display is 5.4 but can be used only 5.2..."
849,4,there is security bridge in face lock so can‚Äôt rely on it fully

851,5,Superb
852,5,"The iPhone is overall superb. The camera, the display, the performance, the sound quality‚Ä¶ you name it, you got it. The only (not so) issue i have is only with battery. With a smaller phone like you‚Äôll have to compromise and being honest, it won‚Äôt bother you that much if you have a fast charger and a power outlet at you ease. It‚Äôll last a day with minimal usage. It‚Äôs a win win for this price. I‚Äôll give it 4.7/5. :)"

The battery is the only issue with one of the worst battery backup . It would barely last full day and only 3 - 4 hours of countinues usage . And if you are considering this for gaming pls DON‚ÄôT it will heat a lot and u can only play about 2 hour of pubg in full battery

3. Touch- Touch response is amazing. I wish it remains the same in future.
4. Performance- I am using it mostly for office works. I can find all my applications working up to the mark.

Cons:

1539,4,"Been using this phone for over a month
Bought it for 37k in big billion sale.
The only downside is battery backup due to it‚Äôs small battery size. Standard 12 will much better with a bigger battery
Camera is really promising.
Overall usage is good
Notch gets in the way and too little space remains for other stuff"
1540,3,Don‚Äôt buy if battery backup is in any of your priority list. I‚Äôve bought this before 1 month and now planning to upgrade within 6 months. Battery backup is ok for light user for whole day. But in video calling 1% decreases in every 2 min. Same with camera during photography. So battery is a disaster. Camera is nice and size does not really matter after using it for few days
1541,5,Nice Performance

Camera is 5 on 5. Compared to my existing s21 plus, it works like charm. Apple‚Äôs image processing technology is just amazing. Night mode is so good.
Bought it for 38k.
It works great as a secondary phone. Due to compact size i am finally able to keep two phones.

One thing i would like to add is please refrain from purchasing 64 gb variant. Iphone consumer 20gb lf storage for temporary files(with time).

1723,4,Well it‚Äôs iPhone. Awesome animations. Smooth working.okay plus battery. Fast charging is a plus. Phone heats up a little with fast charging. Expected it to be more powerful. Without back cover it looks so gorgeous but can‚Äôt afford breaking it so forced to use back cover. Sooo many small small features making it very niche phone. Camera can be better. Video quality is amazing. Wish the notch was a little smaller. Not great for document editing. Reading is good though. Gaming I haven‚Äôt done yet...
1724,5,It‚Äôs a beast ‚ö°Ô∏è . No more words üî•üî•üî• . Camera quality is superbbbbüí•üí• . Screen size is not a big problem . Battery backup was not bad . Best audio and video quality ü§©. Go for white colour it looks very cute üòç . Face ID is soo nice . Face ID will recognise u easily when u stay in any dark area üåö . The camera is a legend üëë . Notch is not a problem . Device is very smooth üî•. Camera night mode is very nice üì∏. U should buy a 20W fast charging adapter ‚ö°Ô∏è.

2095,5,Wonder camera and got the best looks. People may say it‚Äôs a small phone not a good move to get it. EOD it‚Äôs the comfort you want. I love small phone and their usability. Only issue I faced was heating issue that too only when I use google search app. Play PUBg no heating issues. It‚Äôs a OS issue and I guess that will be fixed in the next update.

Blue color stands out in occasional as well as official ."
2152,3,"There is not much special about this phone. The battery drains faster. The camera is so much hyped and you can get better selfies with android phones. Viewing movies , So bad. The details in the movie were not visible because of the small size of the screen. I purchased this just because I wanted an iPhone very badly. But now I regret it. iPhone 12 Would have been a better choice."

For making vlogs and camera suff this phone is more than perfect and worth the price i have paid for it i.e approximately 42,500 for 128gb which was a perfect deal by flipkart big billion day sale.


Love u and thank you flipkart....."
2339,4,"At first sight the phone looked tiny as compared to 6.5 inches screen. It took some time to get adjusted to it. I/Os is refreshing as I have been a android user since ages. It is surprisingly more user friendly and little exclusive. Phone hardware is certainly best in class.
Giving it 4 stars as battery performance needs improvement and Apple can give a USB charger instead of type c will have dual benefit."

2396,5,This is literally the cutest and smoothest phone ever. I shifted from iphone 7 so the screen doesn‚Äôt make much difference‚Ä¶neither does the keyboard. You might find it difficult if you are shifting from a larger screen. But the performance is the best.

2410,4,"Switched from Android to Iphone. Selecting some of the icons are slightly hard sometimes due to small screen(only in the corners - rarely noticeable). Battery lasts for 4-5 hours for heavy usage (approximately) Normal usage 10-12 hours. Need to charge 1-2 more times for heavy users. 0-80% fast charge in 30-40min.

Pros:
1. XDR screen with true tone

Camera is amazing, you can capture sharp picture in low light as well, and the night mode of ultrawide is also amazing.

Battery came as a surprise, it will easily last you an entire day with normal usage and leave you with more than 20% charge by end of the day.

Performance is mind bog..."

If all you require is an audio communication device with added features, then I strongly suggest this. But if you're a heavy media content consumer with the phone being just an added option, this is not for you since battery life is not quite there. But yeah, I think I might end up using it for the next 5 years if all goes well."

It size is handy and all things about this is liked but the battery backup of this phone is not acceptable at this time . On a single charge it runs only 4-5 hours when it is used usually.
After 2 months of normal use the battery of this phone started degraded and battery health comes to 99 %.
I will personally recommend to add some money and opt for 12 and don‚Äôt waste your valuable money in this rubbish product"

3451,4,It's a wonderful phone from apple.. But please be aware about the battery.. It's not enough for a lot of people.. I bought this because I use phones just for minimal activities like mails scrolling through social media and making calls.. Because I always use another device like my iPad for media consumption and other heavy works.. In my case the battery is good enough to get me through a day with some 5 hours of screen time.. But if you are looking for a device for all your activities.. PLEAS...

As this phone is game centric, but doesn't mean one should play games only. Generic user can use that power to finish daily tasks quicker + 800 series survive longer than mid segment SoC's due to premium cores and materials used. Cameras are good not that bad but don't expect much. Attached some pictures before complete switch.

Frame refresh rates during games are also very good. I did see that the fast charger heated up the phone a bit but not so much as to worry

Pros:
Processor works like a charm.
Gaming experience is top notch.
Battery is fine. The default screen refresh rate is 60 Hz and if I increase it to 120 Hz, after full charge and using for a decent amount of time, I am able to use it for a day.

It will be a bit early to judge the phone performance since it will take an update or two to optimize it for onboard SoC.

63,4,"Amazing phone, the camera lacks a bit since its just 48mp and the processor over saturates the images to compensate for that which ends out to be sub satisfactory. The battery life is amazing and the phones works really good too. While gaming for long time the phone tends to heat up, its because the hardware is made to transfer the hear from the cpu to the peripherals so even though it gets quite hot to touch there's no change in the performance"
64,1,"Overall phone is good, but at the time of gaming it overheats to 48 degrees which is not good for such a powerful processor.

Camera quality is not that good as compare to my poco f1.

Battery backup is good it goes around 24hrs of full run in 1 charge."
65,2,"This phone looks great on paper with all its specs, but in reality it doesn't stands anywhere near those expectations. Camera is mediocre. MIUI ruins the experience even more as it's not optimised with the hardware I guess. GPU and RAM management needs to be improved with updates, maybe it can be done. Phone gets warm really quick. Games crash frequently almost every time, maybe because of graphics drivers, which needs to get fixed. Battery is really good, last almost 12 hours with maximum us..."
66,4,"1. Camera not upto mark,unclear selfies

71,5,Very nice mobile. Specifically made for those who wants best performance chipset on reasonable price. Camera loving people may be disappointed due to some companies providing 108 MP camera than it's lowest price. But game loving person will feel happy with its performance.
72,3,U think everything is good bt after some day of use u know the prblms.... The phn is not so cooled.... The camera was not so good and also disturbing sometime to open it .... The processor is only looking so high bt the pubg was lagged also the fps was also very low... So if u want to buy ..... That ur choice bt i advise u to buy anything before knowing everything... Not every good naming product is so good

Display is an issue as it is not so bright on direct sunlight and also mine was defective, has a small grain of sand dot which is not visible unless focused on.

The phone is a powerhouse when it comes to battery and performance. But yes sometimes there are glitches, ghost touches etc which shows there has been considerable lack in quality control.

Ordered and returned one plus 9r twice before buying x3 pro due to quality issue. I can say pocco is a sold mobile with some software glitches which should be addressed in coming updates.

1. It heats but if the room temperature is fine like while using AC or air-cooler, it doesn't heat that much, its just unnoticeable.
2. Second thing is not a con for me, the con is when the speaker is above 50% the back of the phone feels vibrating because of the plastic body of the phone.

The sd 860 is really worth the money. Also camera is decent. You can click awesome shots if u want to. But truth be told, expect what you should from a 48mp camera.

As this phone is game centric, but doesn't mean one should play games only. Generic user can use that power to finish daily tasks quicker + 800 series survive longer than mid segment SoC's due to premium cores and materials used. Cameras are good not that bad but don't expect much. Attached some pictures before complete switch.

Battery is fine. The default screen refresh rate is 60 Hz and if I increase it to 120 Hz, after full charge and using for a decent amount of time, I am able to use it for a day.

72,3,U think everything is good bt after some day of use u know the prblms.... The phn is not so cooled.... The camera was not so good and also disturbing sometime to open it .... The processor is only looking so high bt the pubg was lagged also the fps was also very low... So if u want to buy ..... That ur choice bt i advise u to buy anything before knowing everything... Not every good naming product is so good
73,4,"Camera is good with gcam, battery last long and charges fast as well. Display is an issue as it is not so bright on direct sunlight and also mine was defective, has a small grain of sand dot which is not visible unless focused on. The performance is good but lags sometimes due to bad rom, bought this at 19k big billion, overall a great value for money."

The phone is a powerhouse when it comes to battery and performance. But yes sometimes there are glitches, ghost touches etc which shows there has been considerable lack in quality control. Overall a good daily driver but is it a perfect phone? Nope. And yes back is prone to scratches even if u put a hard case on"

Ordered and returned one plus 9r twice before buying x3 pro due to quality issue. I can say pocco is a sold mobile with some software glitches which should be addressed in coming updates.

1. It heats but if the room temperature is fine like while using AC or air-cooler, it doesn't heat that much, its just unnoticeable.
2. Second thing is not a con for me, the con is when the speaker is above 50% the back of the phone feels vibrating because of the plastic body of the phone.
Rest the phone is all good, it doesn't lag in BGMI(with recording) at smooth+extreme."

The sd 860 is really worth the money. Also camera is decent. You can click awesome shots if u want to. But truth be told, expect what you should from a 48mp camera. Otherwise the phone is literally PERFECT. For daily usage AND for heavy intense gaming sessions."

Phone looks Premium.
Camera is Decent.
AI mode is helpful.
Portrait mode has many features.
Videography Excellent..
Support Video Background Blur in both front and rear camera.
Google Camera is supported.
Memory management is good.

Nothing is bad in this mobile but need improvement in camera.
Exposure is very high which makes image whitish.

OPPO should work on more free themes.
Quality of the free themes are not good..

Phone is damn smooth and if you are coming from Android, you will really notice the difference no matter which smartphone you used earlier.
Pros:
1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes)

11,5,"I have bought the 128GB Product RED version.
Being an Android user, it was a different hands-on experience of the XR and Iam really liking it.
Display looks great, sound quality is great, camera quality is good and mainly the gaming performance is so smooth and fast and never felt a single frame drop ever.

Even though its costly for an ""Budget"" apple iphone, it's worth the money I have spent on this mobile."
12,5,"Great value for money iphone. All rounder. Still a champ to give a stiff n best fights to many same range flagships.
Need an iPhone. Go for it. Good hardware, better with the camera, battery life is can be managed with a day average plus usage.

Talking about the phone - I switched to iOS for the first time.

Camera - Decent camera but there are much better camera out there for the price. This camera is good for 2018 phone but outdated for 2021 phone. If you like to click macro shots of flowers, insects then it might be better to look elsewhere. Landscape and portrait photos are excellent.

3) Camera - Though it has single lens, it is far better than those andriods having 48MP's.
4) Battery - This is big advantage of buying this phone as it has ..."

I did a lot of research about the XR by watching a lot of Youtube videos of what the XR had to offer and the changes made from the previous iPhone models. The first thing is that the XR doesn't have a Finger Print Home Button, instead it uses Face Recognition to unlock it or a Pin Code. Second thing is that the Control Center has moved from swiping up from the bottom to ..."

87,5,"I have been using iPhones since iPhone 4 and I bought this one for my daughter as a gift. Great OS, awesome camera, good battery and amazing built. I was doubtful about the HD LCD Screen but surprisingly the quality is very good and there is no visible pixelation."
88,5,Yaar I am speechless. It‚Äôs a stunning phone and will be a stunning phone for the price tag. It‚Äôs a HD pannel but trust me you can‚Äôt be able to tell weather it‚Äôs HD or Full HD pannel. Baaki toh yaar bas itna hee bol skta sirf use krne ke baad hee samjh me aayega kya cheez hai ye.üëå
89,4,"The phone was a gift for my father. Apart from being on the heavier side, I didn't find an issue with the phone. The hardware, fit and finish and display are spectacular in every way. My Dad being a music lover claims that this is the best sound quality he had ever experienced on any other mobile device! Price could have better though. I still feel the product is overpriced even though I purchased for 54k after heavy discounts. But as long as my father is happy, all is forgiven! :)"
90,4,When we are getting many features at lowest price ... I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs worth spending more than 55k .... as usual apple products are best in performance and all other aspects except price .... go for it if you can‚Äôt use any other mobile other than iPhone
91,4,"Bought this 3 days back and using it heavily.

Charging : Takes 1.30 Hr for a full charging, though apple did little Kanjoosi here, they should have provided the fast charger but anyways its also fine. No issues at all.
Battery: one day usage It‚Äôs good I played Pubg for 4 hours straight , surf social sites for 2 hours, you tube 1 hour and other stuff like book reading, wynk and all.. so at the end I was left with 9% battery. So ya its good.
Camera : similar to XS but slo mo is bit shaky. Rest..."
92,5,"Still value for money in 2021
The only thing is the slow 5w charger ...so u have to spend more to get fast charger .... otherwise overall its good ... I'm satisfied with flipkarts fast delivery i received it on next day"
93,4,"Camera is best part of this phone like any other apple phone. Battery is fine. If camera is not an important factor for you consider buying other android phone at this range as they have better battery, storage and other features. Display and performance is top notch. I just heats sometimes been using it for 3 days. Happy with the purchase just a little overpriced i think."
94,5,I must say its a very good phone! I was confused in picking up the colours and finally bought this coral variant. Its so beautiful i love the blue one too! It has amazing camera but takes 2 hrs to charge drom 0 to 100% overall it is pretty good. Recommend you guys to get it during an offer!
95,4,"Nothing much to write about this product, great phone. Very quick to use. Some key points

1 - Moving photos from android is a pain, Apple wants to ultimately ensure that you're locked into it's ecosystem.

2 - Battery life is ok, with a reasonable amount of use, it can last for a day.

3 - Camera is great in light, but night photography is where this phone lags ( Guess Apple has nailed night photography finally with iPhone 12 ).

4 - I expect the phone to last about 4 years for me. This phon..."

Thank you flipkart & apple for delivering this product"
98,5,"If you're considering iPhone XR in 2021, I think it is still a good choice and definitely a better buy than the SE which looks a decade old.
Let's break down its various aspects-

DISPLAY:
Your screen is something that you constantly look at. I won't say it is the best screen out there in this price range because it's an LCD panel instead of an OLED with a pretty low resolution. But are you going to notice it in daily use? No, unless you're pixel peeping or use to high quality QHD+ OLED pane..."

102,4,"Good iphone in budget to purchase. Feel is totally different from android. U won't get back to android phones after using iPhone. Camera quality is good with good battery back up. Overall a great buy in flipkart BBS at Rs 37,999."
103,5,"First of all thanks to flipkart for giving a very good product
8 years use of android now I m shifted from Android to iOS
Regarding product
Iphone XR is best and value for money
Compared to android
Use of IOS is awesome but first 2-3 days you will face some difficulty how to download apps
How to use all apps once you aware about iOS you will never think of android
Friends phone is very fast
Battery and Display also very good why i didn't know some people are telling display is not good...."
104,5,"Frankly this is my 1st review, and Generally In every 6months to 1yr I will change my phone..
Almost I used all brands(including Apple phone before to This XR) I never feel the smoothness performance and battery life in any other mobile like this in the iPhone XR..

108,5,"After 10 years of android use, decided to try ios. After a lot of research, I bought this beast. First of all, the os experience is very smooth. Very impressed by the performance. I do not take lot of photos and casually took some photos and it is top notch.
Cons:
1. display is just okay.
2. Coming from android, u need to get used to some of the features missing in the ios like call recording (only paid apps in apple store)."
109,5,I jumped from Android to iOS with much excitement n this iPhone XR didn‚Äôt disappoint me. Its such a smooth os experience n performance. Great display good battery life awesome touch n feel ok camera. Its a good buy for iphone lovers!
110,5,"I upgraded from Iphone SE, and let me tell you it is by far the best iPhone you‚Äôll ever have. Value for money, Good camera, Amazing battery life which lasts about 8 hours if you use it excessively. If you don‚Äôt, you won‚Äôt even have to charge for the whole day. Buying this phone was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made."
111,5,Excellent very nice phone. Super natural camera quality. But dual sim slot should be in india i phone bcoz esim not supported by telecom companies.
112,4,Everything is great about the phone except the display. Feels premium.Camera is good but portrait mode works for Human pic only. Display is like 10k android phone.
113,4,I wanted very secure phome in this time when cyber crime is going to upscale. There is no phone in market above 30000 which provide chip level security. ios is more secured than android no doubt. So it was a wise decision from my side to choose iphone xr with decent battery life and every year update i am sure upto 2025. So anybody who think of having a fast phone with security can go with iphone xr
114,5,One the best iPhone out market. Trust me the display is one of the best with most accurate colour reproduction. In terms of speed its like a monster with excellent battery life which can last upto a day and a half for a moderate to heavy use.
115,5,"I first took the feedback from my friends and all said it has good battery quality so why waste money in 11,11 pro or 12 when XR gives you good value for money. üôÇI never bought mobiles online , this is my first purchase and it was excellent üíØüëç. Also I suggest to take a video and check the parcel when the delivery man delivers the item in door step.

137,5,"Battery management of IPhone XR is pretty good having 6hr screen time. I guess 3GB Ram is sufficient for this phone as I don‚Äôt see any lagging. But again it depends how you use the phone.

Camera is quite impressive. And if you have doubt against look wise and then ya that BIG NOTCH will make you irritate.

It supports wireless charging too. It‚Äôs heavy comparable to Redmi or one plus , Due to build design."
138,4,Some time there is a network problem. Price is very high as Compared to other phone which is available in market. If ur iPhone lover the u can go for it. It is better then iPhone XS.

The best thing about purchasing this phone from Flipkart is that they would call you to check if you get the right product or have any issues.

If compared side by side then only you will find the difference otherwise its good.
* Low light photo not that good

You can go for it best phone in 38k"
166,5,"As expected both phone and delivery are excellent and as per scheduled time. Phone is beautiful crimson red with obvious smooth feather touch and clear display. I got great deal too at 37,999/-.

Only downside is apple is not providing charging adapter and earpods with it(citing environmental reason). I have already ordered it. I will be able to explore further Detailed features only after i receive the charger (i choose apple original)."
167,4,Very good display. In fact best LCD display. Amoled displays cause eye strain but LCD display does not. So people having sensitive eyes should go with LCD displays only. Camera is very good too. Moderate usage gives one full day of battery. Performance is good. May be iPhone 12 performs better than this but for day to day usage this is more than enough. Overall the most value for money iPhone.
168,5,At first I must say it's not that bright red it's beautiful cherry red. And it's 100% real and I did all the reality check. Battery is not that long lasting but it can give you backup of 18 hours if you use it so much. Display and camera is outstanding. Super handy and gorgeous. I am now a satisfied Iphone xr user üòä

182,5,"This is my first iPhone purchased in last Republic Day sale.As i am writing this review after a month used almost.

Camera- Super clarity and get nice images.Front camera is OK.
Battery-Lasting for a day for a medium users and bad thing that they provided 5W charger as it takes more than 2hrs.
Performance: IOS is Awesome and no lag while playing Heavy games such as ASPHALT and it‚Äôs like fluid experience.
Display:Even this is LCD screen,colour accuracy is perfect
Sound:Audio sound output is ..."
183,5,I am writing this review after 1 week of use.. This is best phone you can go for.. moving from android to ios i was in a big doubt that will it be the good decision to buying the apple iphone but after purchase i love it. Battery performance is super more than any mi or samsung etc.
184,5,Very smooth performance. nice camera quality. We can open multiple apps mobile wont get struck.. there is not much difference between phone11 and xr except nightmode wide angel lens. Value for money. Go for it
185,5,"I have used iPhone 7 128gb variant. That phone was pretty good but the battery performance is not good. I was to supposed to charge the battery twice a day. Now in iPhone xr i have to charge only one time at the morning and seriously it gives me about 14-24hrs of battery backup (depends on the usage). Camera is awesome, battery is awesome, display is good not bad. Overall i will give the xr 4.8/5 rating."
186,5,"Well, its been 7 long years that I stopped using an Iphone and moved to Android. But boy oh boy I must say I missed my Iphone every single day and then I finally bought the XR Black after a long wait. All I can say is the wait was absolutely worth it and im enjoying my phone every single time I use it and it gives me great joy just looking at it. Once an iphone always an iphone!!!!"
187,4,"I bought this mobile after some research and I am satisfied with this mobile.
If you are looking for an iPhone under 45000k, then XR is your mobile. Great battery backup ,dual sim, good camera and best performance.. just go for it."
188,5,"Undoubtedly great single camera both front & back . Excellent battery. Super fast processor. Smooth experience. Great built quality. Feels premium in hand. At Rs35,000/- (that too with emi during big billion days offers) , perhaps the best smartphone value for money, one can buy in 2020. Thanks to Flipkart."
189,5,Phone is super at lowest price best offers best deals Flipkart is best
190,5,"Great product for the prices iPhones are best value when bought after an year or so of its launch.
Got it for an amazing price smooth experience so far great cameras great battery life when compared to iPhone X.
Display is good too nothing to complaint about
Prrformance is at par with every android flagship on sale
Go for it if on a good price it will last for at least 2-3 years on ios support."
191,5,This is my first iPhone. Great processing power. You can easily do live stream while playing free fire without experiencing any frame drop. Camera quality is great in daylight condition but not that good in night light condition. It captures natural color. Battery backup is good for a 3000mAH battery.
192,5,"Bought XR black 128 gigs. Absolutely Worth and value for money 40-45k budget.
Pros easily out weigh cons. Go for it.

Pros:
iOS. No nonsense.
Security.
Perfect size. Not too big nor small.
Liquid Retina display
Camera is good
Build quality, glass back & premium feel
Face unlock is super quick
A12 Bionic chip. Excellent performance.
Lightning connector headset quality
Apple woo factor.

Minor Cons:
Finger print unlock feature could have helped
Phone weight in hand
5w Charger takes 3-4 hours..."
193,5,"I was so lucky to get this product in 35k.
Pros- Long battery life my screen on time is more that 6hr never thought would get this much.
No legging issue whatsoever, Despite being a heavy user.
Awesome Camera but front camera is not that good compared to other phones. 15k phone front camera can beat it.
Cons-
Slow charger provided in the box.
I find this phone to be on the higher side in terms of weight.

If you are kind of guy for whom front camera is not the key point than you wont find an..."
194,5,"After searching for 5 months i got the best phone in 2020 which is indeed a 2018‚Äôs launched phone. The processor, camera and battery is much better than i phone X. And obviously the value of money factor in comparison to i phone 11. Great !!"
195,5,Fast delivery by flipkart mobile is fantastic for this price range camera is awesome and pubg plays smoothly ....not sure about battery will update about it later....go for it.
196,5,It‚Äôs been almost a month now and I love the experience.. Should buy and yes red color looks super sexy üòÅ
197,5,Phone is awesome... takes time to charge almost 3:30hours to get 0 to 100% although supporting fast charge but you have to purchase a genuine 18 w charger for it. Camera is overall good. Premium looking phone
198,5,"Excellent phone with high speed processor has very decent features and battery life is best among the iPhone models and also suitable for gaming with good graphic.
Overall can buy without second thought."
199,5,"This is my first iphone and i would say its awesome .
Camera is very good
Battery life is really awsome its stands more than 1 and half day .
Phone is really very smoth when you play Pubg while opened multiple apps in background."
200,5,"Best iphone in this budget
Gives a feel of premium phone
Camera is excellent
Battery once charged gives a full day usage to normal user
It is worth buying"
201,5,iPhone is best phone I love it good performance nice camera
202,5,It has been wonderful experience using this phone and going back to Apple. This my 8th iPhone and it still amazes me with its ease of use and simplicity.
203,4,"The Iphone XR has a great camera, good processor and a very good body finish. But the battery backup isnt yet that great. If you use your phone for normal usage like instagram music WhatsApp it lasts for 6-7 hours at max. Battery drops by 1% every 2-4 minutes. The battery is a big issue when it comes to regular users. Rest all works awesome."
204,5,"9-Aug-2019: My first brave step to choose iOS and I don't repent my decision.
1. Compared to Android iOS is so smooth. Super fluidic response and also the security is great.
2. Moving from Android, you need a lot of time to get used to iOS as it's not as easy usage as Android.
3. Activated airtel eSIM in just 2 hours which works exactly like physical SIM.

Disadvantage: There is no finger print reader. This could have been given behind where the apple logo is making it almost invisible to ..."
205,5,"Awesome
Battery back up - full day net on WhatsApp live location on 9am to 10 pm , at 11.30 20% remaining
4k Vedio smoothly playing
No heating issue
Camera equivalent to DSLR , some pop up camera in the market like 48mp its 12 on xr but 1000% better than that.
Red is awesome ( Name Product Red, have a nobel cause also help the cancer patient )
hot spot sharing also great
I think its better than oled, amoled, Display
its very Smooth to veiw ( just like Plasma TV vs Led TV )"
206,1,"Not sure why I bought this. Must be an accident. Why? Will,

1. Display is not even Full HD. Retina display is a gimmick.
2. Camera is overrated. Nothing's extraordinary about it.
3. Performance, well, if you're not allowed to customize, not installing apps or games, how will you calculate performance? Remember, Windows 10 S? It's same.
4. OS is nothing special, like the android. Only miss the Lumia phones!
5. Battery is so so. Better not talk about it. Oh yes, this model comes with a char..."
207,4,"What? Nope, I didn't sell my kidney, because I am rich. But not that rich, else would have bought iPhone 11 Pro Max XS Ultra whatever.
So what's good in this phone? People think I am Ok Rich. And it looks like the same iPhone 7 I had earlier. Even same wallpaper.
What's Bad? My living room doesn't have the LG 4K 55"" TV I wanted cos I spend the money on this one.
Should you buy? Yes, else how will Tim Rob Jobs Cooks or any Apple employee will buy the next Tesla? With your money of course."
208,5,"there is a confusion choose between android and ios ,Now listen me carefully ios gives you smoothest screen feel and performance is outstanding but it fall down in battery quick ,also takes lot of time to charge unless android have now fast chargers that really does the work fast .i would suggest go for one plus mobile they are now coming in more afforadable prices and phones gives premium feel like iphone."
209,3,If u r going to buy iPhone then go for I phone 11 or upper versions. Performance wise I will say it is not the best phone in the market. The best thing about the iPhone is always it‚Äôs hardware. The outer finish is just perfect & it looks really nice.
210,5,Go for it instead of iPhone 11 you can buy iPhone xr every thing you got the same . Happy with the product but not with ekart because the didn‚Äôt exchanged my old phone by making some non sense reasons and also they dot even have a swipe machine in their office the delivery boy said it will be 8-9 pm sir instead you can go office and collect your parcel .. overall phone is pretty good but not happy with ekart services
211,4,"Honest review after extensive use of 1 month.
1. Battery backup is awesome. With internet on whole day and maximal use, battery percentage at end of the day is around 30-40%. This is so far the best battery I have seen in any apple product.
2. Ease of access is also good. Especially the face id makes your locking and unlocking, payment experience smooth and joyful.
3. Sound quality is awesome and with a screen size of 6.1 inch, serves a lot if you're watching a movie.
4. Camera is not up to t..."
212,5,"Classy Phone.
For people out there still confused about this phone, don‚Äôt even have a second thought, just grab right away.
Its been a couple of days I got this phone and I‚Äôm totally in love with it.
Thank you Apple and thank you Flipkart for the quick delivery."
213,5,"Battery backup :
I have been a android user since 2010 and used many android phones this last decade both high end and low end ones and I never had a mobile last me 2 full days of usage!

Android vs iOS :
I want to point out both android and iOS have their merits and demerits but as a consumer we should know exactly what we need in a phone before deciding on the Os .

iOS is comparably slow to android but that's just the extra animations in iOS you could equate iOS to oneui or miui in terms ..."
214,5,This Product was such a good Quality. This IPhone XR Deign quality was very nice. & thank to flip kart to give good product and delivery. i am very frequent customer in flip kart. but i bought this product in flip kart i really appreciate the quality of delivery & easy to access online platform to buy such a good product. i suggest all the Apple Mobiles freaking people buy this product.
215,4,"Very nice phone with good durable built and colors, screen quality is also very nice. Everything is perfect about this phone except that it is a little heavier as compared to same segment of phones. Also price is on the upper side when compared to similar segment of phones but i guess that's an apple trademark ;)"
216,5,"This is my first Apple phone having migrated from Android to iOS. My initial hesitation to be spending twice the amount on this apple phone vis-a-vis any good android phone has been laid to rest after having used this product for last 5 months.
Go for this iphone if you have heavy calling requirements, normal camera usage and need to be assured of a lot of privacy from the snooping apps one does download these days. For me, the privacy part is enough reason to be opting for this reliable device."
217,5,"The item is simply beautiful. More so with its rich, vibrant RED color. Very well designed too. Got a good price along with exchange of my earlier iphone 6. This is the last of the model which came with a charger ( slow one though ) and earphones too. The display is bright and vibrant. Size of the phone is also good. It has weight. Iphone 6 was simply feather light. Everything is slick and fast. Happy with my upgrade and purchase. Easily recommended."
218,5,"Needed to upgrade my phone as I was using a 6s. It‚Äôs a bit large and cannot easily use with on hand as I could the older phone. However performance is excellent and extremely smooth. Very responsive to touch and the Face ID is very responsive. Easy to unlock and have had no issues so far. Ear phones are wired and it has no 3.5 mm jack so older ear phones will not work with this. Overall, very satisfied with the purchase."
219,5,Display is good enough for everyday use.Nothing to complain about.Camera is very good and and phone is smooth in any situation.Battery lasts for about a day which i think could have been better.It is a value for money product.
220,5,Moving to IOS from Android is a top notch experience. User interface is amazing. Camera quality in light is amazing. Battery back is superb for normal use it almost comes for 1 and half day. Touch is very responsive. Face ID is flawless even in low light conditions. U can‚Äôt expect more and it‚Äôs a Must buy product in this range.
221,3,"I‚Äôm using iPhone for several years but couple of things I noticed this time. I switched to this device from iPhone 7 and my feedbacks are -

Cons:
- The phone is very heavy and thick even Galaxy A51 is thinner than this
- The NAUTCH, oh my god üò≥üò≥ its too big for that apple did lot of adjustments like battery percentage doesn‚Äôt show, bluetooth connected device doesn‚Äôt show
- Camera will serve the purpose

I personally don‚Äôt like the big phones for me I guess iphone SE or 12 mini would be go..."
222,5,"Very nice product in this price range (I've got this for 35999). Made in india, nice call quality nice, video recording, little disappointing about camera but it still better than so many phones at this range. I'm using it for past 3days and getting charging backup for nearly 8hrs, if its ur first iOS you will feel some uncomfortable but sure you enjoy useing it. If you have more budget go for 128gb."
223,5,"Really I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking abt phone all the time man it‚Äôs beautiful consistent and super fast ,my first experience with iPhone and I‚Äôm having fun thanks a lot to Flipkart for delivering product in time and seller had it perfectly packed
I‚Äôm very happy with the purchase"
224,5,"Trust I‚Äôm a fan of this device. Probably The best budget product form Apple. Hats off to this device. Top notch performance. Battery is awsome. You may heard that display is not good but trust me you‚Äôll find nothing less in this display. Truly good display quality, and as it‚Äôs a lcd display it helps to reduce the battery usage much more than any other amoled display and neither it will hurt ur eyes. Just go for it."
225,5,"Got it as a gift for my better half on eve of our anniversary. Ideal if one wants to try out iOS after spending long time with Android (for a change in the usage/experience) the phone is available now at a cost effective price, would recommend to go for it!"
226,5,"Amazing phone, upgraded from an iPhone 6s and this phone is a beast. White colour looks the best. Playing PubG at extreme frame rate now. Battery life is great can easily last your for two days if you are an average user. With games it lasts for a day."
227,5,"Very much satisfied with the flipkart delivery
Got it for 36k in big billion day sale
Coming to device,
1.The performance is mind numbing
2.Battery is very efficient though (thanks to the 7nm tech a12 bionic)
3.Dont mind the on paper specs of display,the display is crispy enough and supremely colour accurate(dont compare with amoled) and sufficient brightness even in bright sunlight
4.Sound quality is awesome in this device both from earpods and stereo built in speakers
5.Also no need to say..."
228,5,Totally satisfied with the phone. Worth a buy if you need a smooth battery efficient mobile
229,5,"It's the best phone, It's better than iPhoneX as X have A11 bionic chip and XR have A12, XR has same camera as XS and XS Max. Also with better face reorganization, And the best battery of all."
230,5,"Nicely packed delivered by sfxdel boy opened by my daughter and only delivery boy exit from my premises. This is my fourth iPhone. Xr was my dream because of the features, screen size and pricing.
Now I updated with ios14 too.
Am really happy. This time I choosed White colour, which is really a marvellous piece. Thank you Apple and flipkart."
231,5,"My first iphone and having a amazing experience
Battery back up is too good
Camera is awesome
Best phone to buy in 2021
I am so happy thank you flipkartü•∞"
232,4,Nice mobile apps and performance is very good when compared to other China android mobiles in the market. But overall i still prefer android over iOS as it has more customisation . But if you are looking for mobile with great camera and performance then go for it
233,5,It's an amazing product with high quality camera visibility.... it has a 6.1 inch display that is equal to iphone 11 pro... so it's worth it . N thank you flipcart for the fastest delivery
234,5,"I just got my xr from Flipkart the delivery was really quick I got it in within 3 days whereas the expected time was 4-6 days
I am iOS friendly user I have using iPhone since iPhone 6 then 7 and now xr
The phone is very handy
The phone has a best quality camera although it has a same megapixel that of 7 but still it works more beautifully
The display is a bit yellowish due to its OLED display over all display experience it Gud
The battery is much improved in the xr as I frequently play g..."
235,2,"Functionality wise android is much superior. You will miss a lot of useful features like app lock, downloading of your favourite videos or songs after switching to iOS. Network issue is also there. My mi phone had better network reception than this phone. Camera and audio quality are superb in iPhone."
236,3,Everything good but the main dis advantage is that it will get lot of time to get charged as no fast charging option is available
237,3,"If you are using a Android flagship, never buy an iPhone - EVER.

I was using Oneplus 7T before this and bought for the iPhone brand coming back to Apple after 10 long years. I was extremely dissappoined.
Cons
- Software is 3-4 generations behind Android in terms of user experience. Too many things difficult to do on iPhone, like even a copy paste selection
- Touch is very difficult to manage. Most times it wont select right alphabets and sometimes touch itself is not sensitive
- Resolution..."
238,5,"okay so it has been 3 months using i phone XR and you won't believe how amazing it is.
I was not convinced by this phone before I really wanted to purchase I phone 11 instead of this, but one of my friends suggested me to purchase this in 128 Gb variant it's totally better than the 11, in terms of battery life it looks good, cute, and catchy at the same time
and most important thing you are not getting a power adapter and earbuds in the i phone 11 boxes."
239,5,"First time moved to IOS from Android. Excellent performance, great camera, good battery life and excellent gaming performance. Overall fully satisfied with this device. Sound quality is awesome. My rating to this device is 9/10"
240,3,"I was using one plus 7 before which is way better and cheaper than iPhone XR in every aspect,better display,better performance, better camera and better battery and more storage.i had to buy this phone simply for the Apple Watch otherwise I would have never bought iPhone XR."
241,5,Wow wonder of I phone y people will like Ds nice build quality is superb sound üòé camera üëë nice phone
242,5,"A good seamless experience for most part, my dominant use is calls and basic usage of net so battery life was a priority, which is good and the phone can last 2 days on a single charge for basic usage. Overall a good package in terms of smoothness of OS, features and performance and not to forget a pretty convenient size for old school folks like me who want their phones to be handled by palms and not arms‚Ä¶.."
243,5,"Really I decided to purchased XR with the opinion of the peoples review but really i say the seller is very smart to sell best XR I‚Äôm really very happy to have an this iphone thankyou Flipkart to drop a best price segment and best phone, a person needs that he get all best service in his budget and company never fraud them love this iphone"
244,4,"Product is an original one, good and excellent but there are no EarPods and Charging Adapter as mentioned in the product description. So do not believe the description. It a pure marketing strategy. Saying one thing and delivering another thing"
245,5,"Well,to begin with , I made a major switch... From a mid range xiaomi mobile to this... I was confused between one plus 9 r and this one... But believe me...this might be an old apple product but it wouldn't be in the market if it was capable....

Why to consider :

* if you are bored of using android for a long period of time..go for this
* if security is one of your concerns while using an android device..sw..."
246,5,I think this one is the best phone from Apple. Awesome display with a much improved battery performance compared to other variants. Extremely happy with the phone as well as the delivery. Kudos to the seller and Flipkart!!
247,5,"As a premium phone the quality of the product is nice. Well finished edges. Have a good battery life. For normal use the camera is okay.

Satisfied. Worth for money."
248,4,Awesome mobile. Battery backup is amazing comparable to android phones. Display is LCD but far better than android HD + display. Camera is the best thing of the phone.
249,5,"Apple XR is worth buying even in 2021. Perfect combination of art and technology. Storage and RAM is better than so called 8GB/256 GB phones. Camera is better than 48/64MP...Its quality which matters, not claimed specs.5 star for phone and quick delivery"
250,5,The product which is I ordered is genuine I am loving this I phone xr and enjoying to use this one thankyou Flipkart your trust is remarkable thanks again....

252,5,"I love iPhone it‚Äôs best mobile for valuable money..
always prefer apple family for mobiles."
253,5,"Upgraded from Iphone 6, and I believe this is a really good deal at this price. Battery is excellent, display is great and the camera is just too good. Gives true natural colours.
It would have been good to get the fast charger along with it though. It's also a bit thick."
254,5,"This is a cool phone.
Worth for its price i must say.
The user experience is amazing in every aspect i could think of. As Steve Jobs one said design is not not something you feel or see it‚Äôs what you work with.
i phone never disappointed me except for the price. And this one is worth it compared to other Samsung and google."
255,3,Everthing is good but still iphone 7 plus have way more better speakers rather then XR and the camera quality is not very good. Further if you are looking for budge iphone then XR will be the best choice
256,4,"I loved it. it's beautiful. There's just this heating problem whenever I turn the hotspot on. Also battery isnt that great. You buy you buy a cover aswell, hella slippery. Audio quality is superb. The charging is slow(obviously) but yeah I used the 18w charger for my vivo, there's a significant loss in charging time. Camera is amazing but I wish there was a little more zoom. Face unlock works 98% of the times."
257,5,Very nice phone my first iPhone got it with a good deal on BBD sales very much satisfied with the seller and Flipkart for a genuine product
258,5,"Awesome.. I liked the blue color, which is better than the image, i usually buy black but happy with blue this time, The Phone is nice and charging is faster."
259,4,Purchased during big billion day...phone was delivered on time. I'm a first time iPhone user..little time taken to adjust to the changes in UI compared to android. Yet to completely understand the advantages of ios..2 major points...camera image quality is too good and color reproduction is excellent. Battery is good and for normal usage I'm getting for 1.5 days.
260,5,"Really it‚Äôs an excellent phone after a week i am writing a review about this Good battery back up , Display is really good as I expected .Over all WOW"

262,5,The product is excellent!! Don't even think of neglecting this beast. I would this is the best phone You will get for 40k. Thanks to flipkart for such a superb deal. I was thinking to go for iphone X but I never regret of making a choice to go with Xr. A12 makes the way for a better world. Just go for it man.
263,5,"Thanks flipkart for delivering the product a day ahead. I have one issue though there is a black spot on the rear camera and when I am trying to take a picture it still appears on the picture too.

Coming to xr well what should I say... it is a beast. The best battery out there and best performance and frankly what a camera it is. Hats off for ur work apple keep up the good work."
264,4,"Everything is perfectly fine except the display quality and night mode in camera. If there was a amoled display in it and night shot capability, nothing could have been better.

Snuggly performance and butter like smoothness are simply the identity of IOS."

270,5,superb phone .Design is very good and very slim.Smooth feather touch display and no lag .There are some new features but not many differences than iphone 6 or older models .Good battery life.What i like is touch sensitive is too good and face id is working perfect .Initially you will miss the home button if you have upgraded from iphone 7 gradually you will be adjusted to the phone and what i find is with out home button phone is great and multitasking also working fine .

Further, the Apple help line or service centre are not open on Sundays.
I expected more from Apple if they're serious about the Indian market and if they have to charge a premium for their products."

399,4,Great phone and I loved it. However I feel cheated on the flipkart pricing as you reduced the price from Rs.42000 to Rs.38000 in just 10days since I bought
400,5,Good product overall camera is the best
401,5,i upgrade from android mobile into ios everything is awsome in xr with respect to previous phone i used except battery backup i previously used samsung a71 redmi k 20 so i am used to use a phone with great battery backup so only this is uncomfortable
402,5,"Device is very nice and performance is too good.
If you don't Required 2 camera for specially showoff the must go with iPhone Xr.
Display size are same as iPhone 11."

409,5,Best iphone in this price üëå I love it üòçüíØ
410,4,The product is genuine and services is good but only problem is that the Flipkart shows the high price when we add an exchange phone but when the dilevery boy arrives at home he offers such a low price. This needs to be improved.
411,5,Amzing phone juss wroth it!üòä
412,5,Everything is Gud but apple should include a fast Charger in the box

418,5,"My first i phone, also my first phone bought from my own earnings, apple has it, can beat any flagship phone on the basis of performance, camera quality, battery is good but could have been a bit better, although it was launched back in 2018 still can beat many android flagships. Happy Owner ‚ù§Ô∏è"
419,5,Highly recommended
420,5,Worth for money!
421,4,Value for money and good battery
422,4,"Performance and battery life is awesome.
Wouldn‚Äôt miss telephoto lense"
423,2,The exchange experience was pathetic. With minimal scratches on my iPhone the executive denied taking my phone and gave me a bad value. What was promised was not given for a phone in very good condition.
424,5,"Go for it...
I know you will be jumping between one plus 8 and iphone XR
Trust me this is a better choice.
This phone not only gives u a good performance but class.

PS-Android can never beat ios."
425,5,good dvc
426,5,Bought this for my wife. I use an iPhoneX and this one is much faster than X. Had doubts about display quality as it is LCD and low resolution. Trust me we don‚Äôt feel much difference. In fact visibility under sunlight is much better. Even though camera is single it is better than X. Only drawback is that we cannot take portrait pics of objects. It‚Äôs algorithm needs human face for portraits.
427,4,If you just want to hold and use it as a normal phone go for it no issue with camera and screen but it's comes with a 5 watt charger which takes around 2 hours to charge that small battery battery drains faster if u are into some online games u have to purchase a fast charger for that doesn't come with a fingerprint that makes it little boring to use you can get a better android device for this money If you are a android user and thinking of shifting to iOS don't do it you will thank me later .
428,5,Nice product. Camera and performance are very good
429,5,Very beautiful color. My wife loved it ‚ò∫Ô∏è
430,5,Good one. After watching a lot of reviews got this XR and it is absolutely amazing... I have updated from 6s so obviously battery is beast in this one. Worth a buy in 2020

461,5,"I don‚Äôt regret buying this beast in 2020 .Its now a 2 year old beast but powerful. Iphone 11 and xr are similar devices basic difference is camera,battery,performance. Xr signifies its price. I play pubg alot it‚Äôs a beast in pubg. I play in hdr extreme but doesn‚Äôt lag like other android devices. Best point of apple is apple gives 5 year of updates. Iphone 6s is getting updates it‚Äôs a bit old"
462,5,Undoubtedly IOS is the best.
463,5,Great phone in 2020 even better than rog 3 also u can play 4 hrs pubg on higest setting in xr op phone op performance op battery op camera ip looks
464,5,It‚Äôs worth spending money on iPhone XR in 2020 too. If you wanna buy entry level iPhone go for this model not for SE 2020. It has everything and will meet your expectations for next 3 year I hope. It‚Äôs very well build and feels complete phone.
465,5,Nice delivery by Flipkart and 10/10 in apple xr
466,5,"Best value for money product from Apple. Bought it for 43k by using HDFC credit card and with the discount. Whoever wants to buy an iPhone in 2020 and also wanna save some bucks, go for XR instead 11."

475,5,"Very good phone if you are in apple ecosystem . Because if you consider price to specs , yes there are better performing android phones out there in that price . But if you are picking iphone xr because you use the apple ecosystem and you dont have budget for xs max ,then you are not gonna go wrong with it . The camera is awesome along with the battery life. You are getting the same processor as xs i.e A12 bionic .Gamers would not find any reason to regret.Sound output through the speakers ..."

515,5,Nice apple
516,5,"Thanks to the A12 Bionic and chipset and lower resolution, the battery performance is great, making it the iPhone that could comfortably get through, trust me it‚Äôs worth buying in 2021"

518,4,Average
519,4,Display and sound is great... if you are upgrading from android at initial stage you will find some difficulty but later on you will enjoy the iOS and one more thing your WhatsApp data will be lost on moving from android but the main issue is with charger you will get a normal usb to lighting cable and a 5w charger which charge the phone very slow. The phone is capable of fast charging but you have to a buy fast adapter and a type-c to lighting cable which will cost you approx 3k if you will ...
520,5,Good phone camera quality awesome I am happy
521,5,Still worth it in 2021
522,5,It‚Äôs a best value for money phone if you‚Äôre looking for Apple and you have a tight budget you should go for XR

572,4,Go for it
573,5,"The product is excellent.

Normally people think why to invest so much when other options are available with similar features in low price.
But the product quality and it's performance can only be felt once it is in hands.
It's really "" owners pride, neighbours envy""
Utility for money.
Loved it"
574,5,This is my first iphone.... I'm Very happy to purchase from flipkart....
575,4,1st time using iphone and i love it. I gave 5* to the phone but i‚Äôm disappointed that it didn‚Äôt comes with the bubble wrap.

Don‚Äôt buy from flipkart. I really doubt the quality of phone sold. I am facing so many issues with my phone. The ram management is very poor. It can hardly keep apps in memory. Everytime I open an app in memory, it refreshes again. Also, I face issues with connectivity to wifi. Many times it doesn‚Äôt autoconnect to wifi if connection broke in between.

I loved the camera. Only think I don‚Äôt like is the time it takes to charge. It takes almost around 2 and half hours to completely charg..."
577,5,Best iPhone for the price I got it for 39999 worth it. performance is so gud. heard that xr battery last long than any other iPhone serious but actually it's normal. phone weight is to heavy. over all the phone is osm just osm. if u want to by a iPhone for cheap price go ahead with xr.
578,3,"Awesome handset, Camera is great. Battery backup is nice it works whole day in a single charge.
only thing that bothers me is the bezels of this phone, even after this is a full screen phone i has a very thick bezel on all the sides"
579,4,superb and cool product.
580,3,"Pretty average, 15k for phone, 25k for brand, I am coming from android background, can tell you for sure iOS is useless when compared to android when it comes to user friendly interface.
- keyboard is nightmare
- sound control is hopeless.
- Bluetooth pairing is headache.
- lack of free apps.
- battery is ok
- only advantage is at any point of time there is no lag in using the phone or switching between apps. This is only +ve I found.

581,5,Great experience with I PHONE XR .. Camera ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I love it
582,1,VERY BAD experience !
583,5,Honestly i was bit sceptical about the display quality but it turned out great! Writing this review after using almost 12 months. Never had a single complaint. Everything is perfect. Being an avid gamer and pubg player I bought this phone and it has never let me down. I‚Äôve decided to stick to iOS 13 bcz it runs games smoothly compared to newer roms! The only drawback is the heating but well every other phone heats so cant really complain
584,4,"Outstanding images in daylight.
Battery is far better than se and iphone 7 and 8 plus. It is similar to iphone 11.
Performance is op. No lag in Pubg and COD.
Don‚Äôt go for iPhone 11. It will give you same satisfaction."
585,2,But product price dropped so much just after my purchase & battery is taking 3 hrs minimum to get fully charged. But other aspects are nice
586,5,"Wonderful phone. I don't take much photos so lack of dual cameras doesn't bother me.
It's a beast."
587,5,Nice
588,1,Not buy iphone in this cast any other company good mobile you can take its battery work at list one day but iphone xr mobile batter will be not working if you are using continuous means it will decreases within 5 hours 100% to 0% other nothing problem battery only disappointed

Also i didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúlightning connector‚Äù as it was mentioned on the box but still it was not it inside the box."

596,5,"Have been using this phone since june 2021 and i am really happy with the
battery life
Quality display
Overall worth the buy of an apple product"
597,2,The battery is worst. The battery capacity is falling very rapidly and the customer service just resets the phone and gives it to you saying they can‚Äôt do anything about it. Now I really regret buying iPhone XR.
598,4,"As good as iphone 11. If you are not too fussy about dual cameras, you can go for this one and save about 10k. Super performance as always. Camera is great. Both front and rear."
599,3,It's price around 42k rupes and looking at his performance not satisfy with it.If you thinking to buy this XR for Gaming or BGMI then don't go for this go for 11 or upper or if you have tight budget then you can buy this also
600,1,"Loud speaker when in call is not working properly..
Sound on call is also very very low"

624,4,"Solid Clean Heavy

Good performing daily drive that you can depend on even in 2021 and i guess this would be sufficient for 2022 & 23.

The display is the only downside for this phone but thats on paper, on daily use you would barely notice that."
625,5,Awsome Product Mainly That it includes charfer and earphones....
626,5,Bought for 36k worth buying

766,3,Camera is not upto mark specially in little dark. Picture is not that available in othet low budget handset.
767,5,Good phone and proformens is best
768,1,"Unable to download my official applications, üò¢ Gone Waste. If you want to show off go for it otherwise go for Android phones with great features on same price. Battery life is worst didn't expect that from iphone."
769,5,Good product fast delivery
770,5,So far so good
771,5,Only one word Fasak
772,1,"Phone is not working, no backing up from icloud, unable to set up and there is no return option"
773,5,I love it
774,5,Just go for it .
775,5,Great product
776,1,"After updated iOS 14, facing touch issues, struking issue.. first time feel wrongly purchased in flipkart"
777,5,"Superb Screen display, compare with S8 side by side, this would look gorgeous, S8 may get weaker as days go by but XR would dominate. Seeing the new Iphone 11, its seems better to go with XR or XS, right size phones fit in your hand and pocket."
778,5,"I have purchased this phone on 1st Jun. and the phone turned out to be faulty. Flipkart has refused to give any support foe the 55000 phone which has a big manufacturing defect!! whenever I start the camera app it makes a flickering noise, tries to focus on the object and fails to do so and gets abnormally heated near the camera portion. Feels like my fingers are going to burn! Once I switch off the camera, the device becomes normal.

Update: So finally Flipkart has replaced the defective dev..."
779,5,1st Iphone... Camera n Display is just mind blowing. It's lit bit tough for a android user to make it handy but yeah it will take 4 5 days then you gonna fall in love with this Iphone
780,5,Nice product assume thanks Flipkart I just buy in 36999 with EarPods charger and cable
781,1,I bought this phone in the month of October and today suddenly it got switch off and not able to start it. Its not even a year and the issue has arise. Are you guys selling faulty phone?
782,5,"As expected from Apple, the performance is excellent and battery is mediocre. I would not recommend this to someone who's a heavy user because nowadays we have options of 6000mah battery. However for Apple users it's not new but, the product is value for money. Try to get this deal below 39K, and they release multiple apple offers in a year."
783,2,Camera is worse
784,5,Nice Product üëåüèæüëåüèæ

790,5,My fav was xr coral.. so I chose that..
791,4,Phone is good but over priced and Kangna uses iphone but how her chats were leaked
792,5,"First switch from the Samsung flagships to the iPhone. I must say the build quality, UI and the performance of iPhone XR took me by surprise. Its too early to comment on battery backup and performance, however I am looking forward to a positive experience just as my first impression"

Its only 17 days and my battery health gone 99% from 100% and I am using apple original charger of 5w. Instead my friend bought iphone 11, his daily usage is of 7-8 hours of gaming while using some duplicate fast charger. Still his maximum battery capacity is 100%. Very upset with the apple iphone."

809,5,Everything is good except the charger stopped working on the 3rd day. So Now I have to go to the service Center because of someone‚Äôs fault.
810,5,"It‚Äôs bulky compared to X and XS, however it does the job. Good camera. Takes time to charge, could be better with fast charge feature."

1040,5,It‚Äôs been over 2 weeks using this mobile and it has so far been a tremendous experience. I‚Äôm simply loving iOS. The camera is top notch. The display is very fluid and buttery smooth. Battery back up is excellent on this device. I find only 1 negative and it‚Äôs the lack of night mode in camera and the lack of Ultra wide angle camera. Other than that... no complaints! Happy to buy XR and it‚Äôs damn worth it!

Pros:
Brand value
Great Looks
Build Quality
Superior Network Reception
Display Brightness can be lowered to a great extent
If you are using another Apple product then the intra device connectivity is hassle free.

Battery Life could be better
Face Id doesn't always catch you

1355,5,Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone XR .Love this beautiful phone.
1356,5,No words to describe iPhone!! Just for the knowledge this is the world‚Äôs highest selling smartphone (including android as well) so far..I hope nothing to say more!!
1357,4,"The phone‚Äôs awesome. The eSim creates a nuisance though.....especially with Jio eSim. What I‚Äôve observed is that if the signal drops (like in a lift), then the eSim signal does not come back till you move the phone into airplane mode & back (or restart the phone). That‚Äôs lousy.

And we can‚Äôt use two WhatsApp‚Äôs ‚òπÔ∏è"
1358,1,"Battery is really third class.. it comes with 5 watt charger. you need to charge upto 3 hours. It will work for a day, if you are not using phone much.
Heat by using 2-3 things together like music, maps, bluetooth.
Waste of money"
1359,1,"There is a battery issse ,, battery is not charged over 80%"

1370,5,Osm
1371,1,My edges were damaged
1372,3,I think iPhone XR is overrated. A very avarage cameras. It stands nowhere against Oneplus 7 picture quality honestly. I can show 100 pictures I have captured. Rest good looking phone.
1373,1,Came with a faulty charger cable need to go to apple store to replace it and also iOS 13 was pre installed out of the box i have a doubt it may be a used phone
1374,4,Best budget Iphone ..i got it @ 36K..ultimate deal
1375,1,"Horrible product, very much disappointed, should have waited for oneplus."
1376,1,Camera is just a piece of Crap. Don‚Äôt buy this product. Network reception is very worst and your voice can‚Äôt be heard to other person everytime you call. Battery is also not up to the mark. Front Camera is like VGA quality. I don‚Äôt know why people are overrating this product as just wow.
1377,5,Charging approx 2 hr then 80-85% and camera quality is poor than other phone like s9..

1385,5,awesome product thank you so much Flipkart and all flipkart members
1386,2,It starts hanging in 2days. Battery is not long lasting.. ..only camera is good
1387,1,"After hearing a lot about Apple Product. Somehow I managed to purchase my first apple product from my savings and I have been using this phone from past 1.5 years. Experiencing heavy hanging of the phone while usage. I though of purchasing storage of 50 GB per month charges basis in order to manage hanging problem , I clicked on the backup on iCloud, my phone started hanging more abruptly with screen blinking and unable to switch off now. God save my phone. Unable to solve this problem, even..."

And this is not the first time I‚Äôm facing this issue. My last ip7 had the same problem.
Both the phone died while I was on the phone and both had a battery of ~80% when they died!
This one died when it was still under warranty!!
Apple quality has dropped drastically"
1394,4,Phone is very good. Only issue I saw from a week's usage is the heating problem during charging and viewing videos for more than a hour
1395,1,Garbage
1396,5,I had iPhone XR black and wanted to buy another one for my wife and confused in colours and in last ordered white colour and it‚Äôs looking more beautiful than black one.. everything else is good that‚Äôs why ordered my second one
1397,1,"Don‚Äôt buy this product. It‚Äôs pathetic. I‚Äôm facing so many issues with Battery and Charging Wire. They‚Äôre saying it is not included in warranty. I‚Äôm literally struggling. Don‚Äôt make the mistake which I made. Once you buy it, Apple will not own anything of it. You‚Äôll have to bear all the problems and their cost on your own. Please don‚Äôt go for it. I wish if I could give it a 0 star rating."
1398,5,Best iPhone ever! I already own a XR got this one as a backup iPhone and it‚Äôs stunning and perfect! 10 out of 10 rating! Thanks Flipkart for original product!

1480,5,No comments
1481,4,"As for protection is concerned, Could have provided a temporary screenguard atleast, along with a back case."
1482,4,This is the 1st iPhone we have bought. Now we know why it's difficult for anyone to switch from iOS to Android. Even though it is costly but it is a complete package. The only con as per me is the weight. Rest all it's the best flagship phone anyone can buy.
1483,5,You use it and you forget android completely its true
1484,5,"Probably best iPhone in these price range, except Display nothing is compromised."
1485,5,Great phone

Simply don‚Äôt buy. As like other, I have bought it to serve my lifestyle purpose nothing else and I switched this product from one plus 6. Believe me that 1 and a half year old purchase still is better than this product in all aspects:

Performance
Battery life

Multitasking
Camera
Ease of use
Apps availability

What else not! Just don‚Äôt buy... believe me DONT BUY. You are gonna regret your money."

1498,5,My first iphone. Truly amazing. Very good camera and battery. Battery charging speed is very low. Have to spend another 1800 for apple fast charger to get the device charged in 2 hours. Eveything else is superb.

1507,1,It's very bad Phone.. don't buy this phone.... specially this seller
1508,1,"The product is not promising as demonstrated in most of the reviews. It is just a name.
Android are way a head in terms of user and interface.
from the first day i am getting hangging issue in my iphone XR"
1509,1,Bakwas phone .. moved from Android to iOS... Feels like a generation backwards.
1510,2,I was under the impression that iPhone would be much different from rest of the phones but was disappointed. It is no different. Battery does not last very long. Camera not very powerful. All in all there is nothing great about it. I can‚Äôt understand why it is so expensive.
1511,5,Nice products
1512,5,nice phone. worth for money
1513,4,"the front camera is literally bad . but the back one is love ,overall it's good but the battery life is still very low ."

1515,1,Just a brand . Nothing worth money
1516,5,Its chinise
1517,3,Never expected such a unfair camera performance... OnePlus is much better than this phone camera... Really disappointed with camera performance.. and still there is no update for camera from Apple

1523,3,Not good not bad very heavy heat this phone

1534,5,Very good and best performing phone from apple love it
1535,5,"It's Apple. So no questions on overall quality.
It's just that XR could have been more better from camera and screen resolution/pixel density standpoint.
Photos come out pretty well but could have been better. Battery backup is good in XR. Sound is loud, crisp and clear. It is fast and processor does the job well. So, that's it."
1536,4,Everything things are great but slightly heavy
1537,5,One should always experience it
1538,5,Value For Money Phone . For people who are looking for Apple Products but donot have the obsession of owning the latest one. Functionally not much difference between it's elder ( in terms of price ) siblings
1539,3,Everything is fine except IOS. Hopeful to switch back to my Galaxy soon :)
1540,5,"Good thing about iPhone, it reduces your phone/screen time.

Charging: lasts for one whole day.

When to charge: charge it overnight. That is what the Apple website suggests. When the battery is full, the phone stops getting charged. Moreover the phone learns from your charging time and fills the battery accordingly. So... YOU CAN NEVER OVER-CHARGE YOUR PHONE.

1. Touch isn't as smooth as other IPhone I have (purchased from canada)
2. Signal strength is way too weak. Even my galaxy s9 has better signal strengths(cellular and wifi both) than this
3. Found camera to be not at par with the other Iphone X that I have, seems worse than that.
4. Vibrations aren't as strong as I remember Iphone usually has

Other than that, phone works fine. Not as good as I expected it would be"

3649,5,Excellent product and the best part which makes it different is it‚Äôs battery life. I watch a lot videos ok you tube and use all social apps but still I have battery left in night. It‚Äôs Canera is too good especially the depth feature. This only thing I personally feel is that size of mobile should have been but short to make it handy. People who like big screen for them it‚Äôs cool. I was using I phone 7 till now and I still find that handy in holding the phone.

I purchased white iPhone XR and believe me its just beautiful look wise.

Its a true value for money and i am not regretting it one bit. :)"
3826,1,iPhone design is very obsolete. All iphones look same since iphone x. Notch is very annoying especially when other phones are coming with almost all screen displays. Peculiar problem in covid era is unlocking the phone while you are donning a mask. This phone doesn't unlock by any other method except faceid. I had to type passkey every time i was using mask. Very annoying. Back camera is single. Photos are okay for single camera but not as good as multicamera systems especially in this price ...

2,4,"First I would like to thank you Flipkart for fastest delivery and yah the delivery guy is so cooperative and helpful
Samsung phones are always best in performance and this one is also affordable and awesome phone"
3,5,"Pros:-
Battery backup is simply awesome. I got 8+ hours SOT
Performance is way better than Xiaomi and realme at this range. Bloatware free and no junk apps. Previously i was a Motorola User so i miss Moto tweaks, thats all. This gap is fulfilled by Samsung one UI. lots and lots of customisation.
Samsung brand is trust. Phone is Durable and service centre are very helpful
This is myth exynos are not good. Trust me, in real life in doesnt matter until and unless you do heavy gaming at very high..."
4,5,"Best mobile for in this price range, Battery backup is highlight. Better go with this mobile in budget category from best brand. Absolutely perfect mobile."
5,5,"Camera is good battery is good fingure unlock sensor is very good and fast it is very thick due to large battery this phone is not for slim phone lovers but phone is very good and price are also good , good job samsung"
6,4,"Nice phone. We can rely on Samsung than any Chinese company like MI, Redmi, Poco, Realme, Vivo, Oppo etc.

Little heavy and thick than others but best in this price range. Rear and front cameras are superb.
Not has SAmoled display and you can't expect it in this price.
6000 mah battery is just wow. Power packed phone.

But the Charger is of 9V and there is mentioned that it is of 15V.

It did justice with its price. Value for money and trust of Samsung.

If you are willing for it, Go ahead üëç"
7,5,Overall it is good value of money. Everything perfect except taking about 3 and half hour to take full battery charge which is painful. Samsung should work on it.
8,5,"According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.
As in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well ..."
9,1,"The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display..."
10,5,"It's fantastic phone actually .
Especially battery backup is very good upto 2days with a single charge..
it's nearly 1/4 kg..
Anyway best phone under 12k"

Camera quality is good in this price point.
Performance is also good in this range
Battery life is good but it doesn't support fast charging so i didn't feel good about it.
Display isn't good ,cheap display i am very Disappoint for it.....
Overall you can buy this but if you want good display so don't buy it."
12,5,"Using the phone for the last 13 days.

‚Ä¢The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.

‚Ä¢I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.

‚Ä¢The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

‚Ä¢ Overall, I love this phone. No complains."
13,5,"Really loved the build quality.........smudgeproof üòç
Display is quite bright what I expected it got more brightness. Battery is huge 6000mAh & u can use it for 1 - 1.5days straight without any issue also u can get 2days if u r a light user.
Camera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that.
Regarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one.
In short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG."
14,4,"Overall good camera and battery phone in this price.
Camera quality is very good.
Battery also good last upto 2 days.
Performance good like any other samsung mobile.
Sound quality is very good.

Back panel looks outdated.

Overall good phone in this budget range."

If you need a clean. And good simple degine working performance.
It's best.
And if you need best of the best photo, then plz buy a DSLR not a phone."
16,4,"Low light camera is not good , selfie is average but looking wise it's a good product .
Performance is good with average gaming
Battery pick up also good

Overall value for money"
17,5,"Go for it if u r not a ardent game lover like pubg,cod.
4 out of 5 for this budget range.

Good build quality
Pros:
Definitely the battery. It's real good
Display looks good.
No lags. Yet to try high storage games. Handles 6 to 7 apps seamlessly
Back camera is good.

Cons:
Selfie camera could ve been better. As Mi phones offer good camera quality for this price range
No back cover. Even simple one.
High wattage battery, but atleast takes 2hours to full charge."
18,5,Really amazing üëèüòçproduct I'm totally satisfied with it if anyone is willing to purchase a new phone I will recommend you to purchase I have also ordered another same product for my mother it's really nice u can rely on it value for money üí∞

Sound quality is not that great but its okay. There are some amazing advance features. A bit heavy though. Overall this is an amazing phone in this budget.
22,4,Camera is not so good . Battery is not like 6000 mah . Only phone look is good .

It's a cool phone.
As it's a med range phone.."

25,4,Good features and camera quality is good and powerful battery and nice and auto call recorder option is also available if don't want auto call recorder option manual call recorder option is also available but the problem is we should have click tow time to open any thing other good phone value of money and most recommended
26,4,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.
27,4,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI
28,5,It is very very nice and it's is Battery preformance is awesome it can for 3days and it performance of the chip inside super more faster .camera also good .
29,5,This Phone is awesome in this price point it has some graet features and I liked this Phone The display is HD+ but it fells like FHD+ the colurs and contrast are very good.And also the delivery boy was very cooperative
30,5,"display and camera are way better than chinese competitors in this range.
people writing review like they are paying 50000 bucks.
i got it for 8549 and under 10000 this is best you can get."
31,5,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.
32,5,Fabulous budgeted phone. Use to gift üéÅmy wife she is very happy with this fantastic gift and amazing performance. 5star to this mobile and Samsung too‚ù§.

34,3,"Listing out only most desirable points to know from realtime usage. Others you'll find on online reviews.

Pros:
Efficient battery. It doesn't go well with gaming though
Handling the device is easy for people like who spend a lot of time outdoors, given you equip with a right case
Good build - surely will last for 4 years without intentional or accidental physical stress

Cons:
Mediocre camera for this segment. At this price you'll get awesome image quality from Mi, Realme and others.

35,5,"Nice
Phone in samsung budget series I love samsung products quality , after sale service , the support, security updates all in all great company ...."
36,5,"Superb Phone......

Don't look at the negative comments if you are not a heavy gamer (Pubg, Call of Duty, etc.). Light gaming like Subway Surfers, Temple Run runs very smoothly in this phone.

Pros:
1. Big Display (6.5 inch). Brightness and display quality is also good. 90hz display is also an advantage
2. Big Battery (6000 mAh). It gives 1 day battery backup after heavy usage and it may be used for 2 days on a single in light use.
3. Camera is decent. As always Samsung camera is very good.

43,5,"Literally the best of Samsung in this price range.

Camera quality is really good, not the best, but OK.
The 48mp rear camera is the best, other three cams are not upto the mark. The selfish camera is better.

Battery lasts upto 1 day even on continuous use but it takes time for charging.

It is not recommended for gamers, but for a regular user or student who uses for attending online classes, calls, multitasking, It is highly recommended.

Display is amazing. Adaptive 90hz display is very s..."
44,3,"You use it as a secondary phone not primary
And the pros are
1 big battery
2 big storage
3 processor is all right
Cons
1 display not that good
2 camera is ok not upto the mark
3 audio is not upto the mark
You can go for micromax in note 1, it's far better than this"
45,4,"Review after 3 month of use:

1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark...4/5
2)Screen or display is bit disappointed as resolution not that good .but its ok for this price tag...3/5
3) Performance is good if you are using genral purpose.but not that good or smooth for playing high resolution games like COD or PUBg.3/5
4)it definitely a value for money and more important it is not Chinese . If Samsung improve and more features in One UI .also it has samsung ads or bloatware .4/5"
46,2,"When I was ordered it is M12 , but I received F12.I don't know why it is happened and what is the difference.
Camera clarity is very bad. My redmi Y1 13MP camera clarity is far better than this M12 or F12.I was purchased due to 48MP camera."
47,1,"Display is waste even less budget phones of other brands compared to this have good display.....camera says 48mp but trust me it's not even 8mp camera also.....speaker volume is less...... never expected this from a brand like samsung....... samsung manufacturers the display and supply to all other brands but Samsung itself should work on his phones rather....... totally bad experience.
Please go for any other brand......if u buy this phone simply u will not satisfy."
48,5,Good option for normal users. It will be good if a back case is provided along with the package. 6000mah battery might not as good as others. But for a Samsung phone this is the best option. Quad camera set is is just okay. Macro shots and all are just average. But the wide angle camera is the most attractive one in this price range. The display is fine. Much brighter and clearer one. The phone is little bulky but it won't be a problem for us. For gamers you may skip this phone. This is not ...
49,5,Selfie camera is not much good as expected. Main camera is ok. But the rest of all the performance is the best I loved it too much. The 90hz display performs like pro. Very very fast response of screen. Battery lasts whole day long for online classes. Overall it's a beast in this budget.
50,4,"A nice product in affordable range. After Using Vivo, Redmi and Micromax , which boast of good Camera quality and attractive accessibility options but finally ends in software/ hardware issue, sluggish performance i have returned to Samsung after 3 years.

52,5,"Bought this as a second phone. Was looking for a cheap reliable one. So went for a Samsung phone. Given the price, the display, call clarity and performance are good. Camera is also reasonably good. But then if camera was main function one needed, the budget would have to be stepped up. So overall, a very good phone for everyday use"
53,5,"Very well balanced phone - Camera, Battery, Display & Antennas - best in this budget. Additionally, an excellent software experience!"

58,1,"Recently bought samsung m21 for father which had oled screen so expected f12 to be better than that but turned out to be far less than m21 for almost same price. Poor screen color, poor camera, wifi also only 2.4 gz and not 5 gz. One good camera would have been sufficient instead of 4 bad cameras. Pics captured look like artificially painted. Worst boot time. Looks great only from outside, but internal are strip down like anything. Samsung should stop fooling people."

61,4,"I loved the part of delivery from Flipkart and a good phone in this budget especially when it is NOT CHINESE and MADE IN INDIA.

For a regular use, this phone is nice with good battery and camera.

Just 1 star is less because, it feels thicker than expected. Rest everything is perfect."

67,4,"Reviewing after 2 days use. Mobile has heating problem while usingand charging. Overall features are best. Go for this mobile. But you can't use this mobile for high level gaming like PUBG,BGMI and FREE FIRE. For gaming purchase Media Teck Helio G or P processor mobiles. I love this phoneüòá. The features are just awesome and you can't compare to other mobiles. Such a best display, sound and fingerprint sensor at power key,call background features....awesome...awesome and awesome üëå"

70,4,"Good phone. Camera quality, display is good. Gives good battery backup. Only and main problem is sound quality. Volume of the phone is very low. music or videos cannot be enjoyed and we can't here properly if speaker is on during call. Also the Dolby Atmos feature is disabled in the phone and there's no option to enable it."
71,4,"Phone is very good but there is no screen guard and phone cover , Samsung should give this.

Every thing is fine but i don't like the camera quality , specially the front 8 MP selfie camera is not good and back camera is OK not bad ."
72,1,"Like it's camera is is like 48mp.
It's take too much time to charge.
I recommend realme narzo 30a on place of this phone. Realme is better then samsung .
It's has very less features.
It doesn't have even Restrict background data . Or data speedo meter.
It's screenshot taking method is worst.
It's has soo many pre installed app that we could not delete.
I repete REALME IS BETTER THEN SAMSUNG."
73,3,"Pocket friendly but not exactly pocket friendly. Other words it's great value for money but due to 6000mah battery it becomes think like 90s mobile phone. I think we don't need 6000mah battery as any way we are home in this lockdown. Apart from phone thickness everything is just awesome, perfect blend of memory, display and cpu. Awesome display. Samsung you rock always."
74,5,Good and fantastic and very happy and lovely mobile
75,5,Very best phone for the price according to lg w30 and w31 model with same specification are costing more for the price it is best and awsome to use very perfect for office use i have stored 62 gb full of data but it doesnot hang till now very awsome for the price and battery stands for 2 days
76,2,"1. camera not clear like 48mp (May be it will be clear after update). But many features.
2. Smooth performance. Though Sometimes it slows down while multi-tasking in high speed. But it is quite natural for any phone. It has pop up. Split windows and many more. Amazing.
3. No hitting issue.


4. Battery lasts for 3 days in regular use.
5. BEST PHONE IN THIS BUDGET.

.. . ....NO APP LOCK, NO COMPASS. ......

üß∏ APP LOCK AND MORE SENSORS COULD BE GIVEN."

Cons:

2. No back cover provided
3. Feels little heavy in initial days but later gets used too it."

If anybody want to buy this for thinking good camera I recommended to go with Realme.
Battery backup also less ."
83,4,"Got this for my mom..infact the first ever Android based Samsung phone brought in my history.

Good things:

3. Decent RAM management.
4. Good update timeline.

84,4,Overall performance is good for medium use. Battery life is pretty good. For those who's looking for playing High graphic games than don't go for it. Camera performance is also average. Not so high not that bad. It's Not perfect for Photography lover. And Yeah it's little bit heavy. Weight is around 240-250Gms.
85,3,Display is ok ok..as compare to AMOLED screen.Other things like battery and hardware performance is perfect..4gb Ram and 128 gb is nice combination..Overall phone is good in this budget.
86,5,Wonderful product... good battery life.... nice display.... fast biometric... over all the product is worldclass but they should improve camera quality...# value for money
87,5,"This is the best phone if you are looking for under 10000. It's performance is best. In some of the 4 gb ram mobile phone if you will open heavy games like cod mobile,free fire,etc and then go to the recent tab and open them they will restart but in this it doesn't restart. That's a good thing of it. It's camera is only a bad thing as there should be more modes for camera. However this phone is excellent"
88,4,"Phone was delivered per time frame.....
If asking about the phone, best phone for the person who is Starting to get a touch of technology or for a light user
Best thing about the phone is the Samsung One UI
Its the twin brother of M12 > Same features ,there is no even a slight change
Other than that there is nothing else to post
If you want best value for money at this price range go for ""POCO""
Or you need a lesser priced samsung device go for M11"
89,4,"I have never had a good experience with Samsung mobile before.So I always use a different brand of mobile.After reviewing of all good,the Samsung F12 galaxy was bought.

Quality of product & finishings too good in this price.Operating speed is excellent and easy accessible.Light weight.

The quality of pictures taken from all rear cameras are very good.But not good results of front camera with compare of different brand.

And also thanks to flipkart for very fast delivery within two days."

Pros:- 6000 mah battery
6.5'' display
Con's:- Bad Processor, very cheap
Bulky
Poor camera 8 mp is better than this Samsung claims 48 but in one specific mode no zoom.low light performance horrible.
I won't recommend this phone to people out there."

Camera - below average, sometimes it didn't open and take much time to save image. Too much lag in Camera.

Battery- on paper it's 6000 mah but it's not even working as 5000 mah battery, charging time 2.5 hours to 3 hours and 15w charger is a joke on..."

It's a complete waste of money.. Flipkart should arrange for replacement with better mobile with extra cost if a customer need. I am facing thermal throttling with my phone after using it for few hours with light usage. As this phone uses a powerful chipset this is not expected to happen.

615,1,Overheating issue. You use for 15 mins and phone will get overheated. Very bulky you will feel like holding a brick. Battery charging will show you time of 2hours 40 mins and even after 3 to 4 hours it will be charged only 50% to 60%. Also feel like at some place touch is not working properly need to click twice. Finger print sensor also useless rating 1 star only. Poor product.

Pros
1. Big battery.

Samsung is now degarding its image as i've been coming across many cases of samsung phone where issues are been observed within 6 months.

Camera features are better useful for some professional enthusiasts.

7,5,"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model.
Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say.
Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good."
8,5,"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" üòÑüòÑüòâ"
9,4,Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.
10,5,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedback
Bass : 10/10
Clarity : 9/10
Comfort ease n looks : 15/10
Features :10/10

The best buy from flipkart yet.."
11,5,Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great üëå and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great

16,1,"This headphone is good but not that much as i expected
*Pros- 1Good battery backup
2Good sound quality

*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointed

Overall not good
Don't buy please"
17,3,Almost all good bass ok not more then JBL and real me but ok soft bass like it and one more thing headset earbuds not nice not comfort to listen long time just for 30mins ok and not comfortable with earsbuds design not nice boat 255 is the best design earbuds overall i will give rate for boat Rocker 235v2 ( 8/10 rating)

19,4,It's a very good product... I'm so happy with this Bcz it's bass quality & sounds is too good & battery backup also superb
20,1,Mic is not proper recipient persons can't hear proper sound ( every time for call I heard from front I can't hear you so I have to again talk to through Mobile phone no Option useless of wirless meaning) and sound quality is so loud. Like local headphones. not comfortable to wear for more than1 hrs of uses.tere is no meanings to get replaced again you get same product therefore this is wast of money.

33,5,It's a Awesome purchase. Value for money. I can't expect that type of sound and connectivity will get in this price range. Last time I bought Boult ear buds and refunded due to charging issue and connectivity issue. That sound was not as powerful as this Boat headphone provides. Really happy to advise all of you if are searching for Bluetooth headphones please go for it. You will get everything you are searching for. Thanks Flipcart. And request all of you please go for only Indian Products.

First of all bass is good if you love bass then go for it without second thought.
Lags in build department as wires are thin.
Have magnetic buds with no functionality i don't know why they provided.
Connectivity is good i can hear music from one room to other without much distortion.
If you are buying for general use like music and stuff then it's okay but for gamers or i say pubg players then you will be disappointed becoz they are just bad in that department the..."

Sound quality is good for the price , the battery life is great in this price range
but in real life
The earphones are not so comfortable for your ears , just after 30 mins it's feels uncomfortable in your ear.
The built quality is average.
Don't go for the boat logo

117,5,"Design and build very good nice
Sound clarity is awesome
Bass is as clear. But not for bass lover. I love clarity and I got on this.
Batery is one day all time connected.
I got as I exceped."
118,3,"It's not too good ,
When I play any song fast I hear a sound like ""kachh"" sound quality is not good"
119,5,"I think for this price range, it's one of the best available in market. sound quality is good and loudness is nothing short of excellence. Bluetooth connectivity is too good. Satisfactory with looks and build quality, could have been better."
120,5,Really awesome product by boat with stylish design.& Battery backup is just awesome with fast charging technology just go for it guys
121,4,"Although it's too early to write a review after just one day of use but I was using skullcandy method for two years but due to support local manufacturer this time I decided to purchase these earphones and believe me it's way more better than any other so called established brands.
Sound and Bass are next level cool
Bettery back up is also good
Vibration during incoming call is a feature which was missing in skullcandy method which was 3200 while it's cost is 864(During sale)."
122,5,Bass too good ..but Dolby sound s not clear and left right sound output not here .. this s full base centre sound effects ly .. song left right music 0% .. middle bass middle sound music ...
123,5,Fastest deliver ( i recieved the product in the next day ) & amazing product with good sound clarity. Great battery backup
124,5,Must buy bluetooth headset. Guys blindly go for this headset. Very very worthy. It looks like more premium and got good design. It looks more premium than 255 F model. The most important thing in this headset is adjustable wire strap.
125,5,Just go for it.... u cant purchase better wireless earphone at this range....its sound quality is not so good on watching you tube video but it is fabulous when i listend it from Wynk music app with changing in equalizer....i recommend u to listen songs on this on ur music app....it is far better.
126,4,"Each and every thing is good corresponding to this value but my micro cable charger is not suitable for this Bluetooth and not working properly . Micro cable charger is not fitted properly, not fitting completely ."
127,4,"It's works fine and superb with this budget. Only thing is it will not compatible for PUBG game you will get the sound later for every action.
Ex. You get the enemies foots sound after arrival means later."
128,4,"Good quality sound output from the earphones. Battery backup is good as per product specification do meets the exact backup time. Reacharge also won't take much time. Only thing I found little bit bad was the thin wires used. If you are a tough user go for flat wired type boat models, this one could break if not used safely and softly. Good product."
129,5,Good Quality i use this everyday but its design is have to like Samsung's level U product. Otherwise its sound quality is awesome in this price level.
130,3,"positives - *good & fast battery
*Very good sound quality
*Sleek design and colour
Negatives- *range is too short. Compny claim 10 mt but it was maximum of 6 mt only. i've tested many times.
*If u use in open environment little bit of air disturb ur sound no matter the how near u with ur phone.
I give it 3 star because range is most important to me and full marks om design n battry"
131,5,"Super sound clarity and really good quality deep bass,and very fast charging.
Thanks flipcart for quality product."
132,4,Wires connected to the earbuds are very thin...it would be great if the wires used were thick. Otherwise it is great experience to use it...looks far better than boat rockerz 255f as it is very outdated now.
133,5,"The best product in this price range. I mean what more can you expect from a product @899/- only.
Sound quality is average. Clarity is not good. However bass is good. Battery backup and fast charging is awesome."
134,5,Super fast charge.sound was good bass also good
135,5,"I have purchased it in 899. After using 3 days I am writing this review.
It has very good battery backup. In 10 min charge you can used it for 2.5 hr. Sound quality is good. It has good bass as well.
Previously I was using boat 255 and it has better bass and design as well.

The issue in it the connectivity is not much good. If you have put mobile in your pocket then Somtimes you will feel distortion.

But if you love balanced music, then it is not for you. Go for others Brand with more ..."

153,5,I love it specially because of battery backup.. sound quality is actually good but if you looking at it for calling purpose only so don't buy it. Noise cancelling doesn't work properly in these earphones others wise very nice product for those who love watching movies for hours and play games too
154,4,"Guys, today I got my order. The sound quality and the bass is awesome. but don't buy this for PubG as you get latency. you will hear after 2 - 3 secs of firing, footsteps, and messages. So, for music and calls its pretty good but for gaming don't buy this. Go for 255F for PUBg."

168,5,I bought it for my mom and it's good.....well just good nothing more there are some issues but they can be neglected considering the price so if someone is on a tight budget then this is good or else I will recommend to go for oneplus bullets z earphone they are far better than these.

Here are the pros: Good sound quality and bass, Bluetooth 5.0 with easy connectivity, Water proof and sweat proof.

A few times there is some sort of connection problems and the headset keeps disconnecting and reconnecting, but it happens only once or twice in 2 to 3 days so nothing to worry about.
Also while answering calls sometimes though the headset is connected you wont be able to answer and the inbuilt vibrator wont stop even after answering the call through your phone.

415,4,"So I have been using these for about a month now. The battery backup is good which usually lasts 8 to 9 hours. But you can't actually use once it reaches 20 percent. It starts annoying you with 'battery low' message every 20 seconds or so. They could have set the annoying threshold to 5 percent. And driving on 2 wheelers with these is a nightmare. It flies away if you drive fast even while not using it with the magnetic earbuds connected. Sound and bass is good considering its price (899)

1196,4,"Voice dropping and bluetooth interference is very frequent and spoils the experience of superb sound quality, battery backup and product design which are the best you can find at this price"
1197,5,"Writing this Review after 23 days of use.
1. Battery backup is off the charts. They say 8 hours and they give it.
2.Quick charge. I've never charged it for more than 30 minutes and it stays live whole day.
3. Sound quality is good, not the best.
4. Latency is there. So if you're planning to play online games like COD Or PUBG it'll get you killed. Expect a minimum 1 second delay.
5. Phone calls won't be private anymore, you'll need to speak louder than usual in order to make conversations ..."
1198,5,Sound is good. Battery backup is amazing. Got it for 999. Satisfied. Design can be improved.
1199,1,"Waste of money

1248,4,"I got this product for 865 rs.
In this price i feel it offers quite turbulent sound quality. You can compare this profuct to other competitors of around 1000rs. Or so.

Pros: good battery backup, good sound quality overall, satisfsctory bass, good build quality for the price, light weight completely no issue in wearing for longer hours.

Cons. Highs n treble bit on d average side.

Anybody who is on a budget of less than 1000 rs. N looking a bluetooth option can surely opt for it."

It's by far the worst product I have ever seen or purchased till date. If you're an Indian company, you should create a brand that you can be proud of. What's the point of selling something that has to be returned immediately?
Will never again purchase anything from Boult. Terrible product. Shame on the company."

If you nod your head your call gets disconnected. It's not a technical issue it's just a bad product. If the company is selling the product for 999 max of the time why value it at rs 4999.

Pros

1)Sound quality is good but not the best.
2)Battery backup is also not bad. After a ful charge, playback time will be around 3-4 hrs.

Cons

1)Bluetooth connectivity is a major issue I faced. Connectivity gets lost or disturbed on moving to a next nearby room within a radius of 5-6 metres.
2) Microphone if available is the worst ever. On attending and speaking over calls, the person on the other side hardly hears what I speak when earbuds are connected...."
